                        Fused deposition modeling, or FDM 3D Printing, is a method of additive manufacturing where layers of materials are fused together in a pattern to create an object. The material is usually melted just past its glass transition temperature, and then extruded
                        in a pattern next to or on top of previous extrusions, creating an object layer by layer.

                        will form the finished part.

                        Standard resin is a translucent material with a yellowish color, which is constructed from liquid resin hardened by a laser. It’s a low-budget resin that offers great surface quality and a high level of detail.
                         Because of the structure required to support your model during printing, freedom of design is limited.
